## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a launch/home screen that matches the app aesthetic and lets users open an already-loaded story or pick a new story source. The story view should be presented as a child screen from this main entry point.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Added a launch screen with story status, preview card, and story source actions.
- Story view now navigates as a child screen with playback bar padding.
- Story picker auto-opens the selected story after loading.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->
