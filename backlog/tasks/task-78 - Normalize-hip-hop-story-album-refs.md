## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Update authoring guidance to default to explicit album versions and audit hip-hop story album references for explicit, non-deluxe originals.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Updated AGENTS-authoring guidance to default to explicit, non-deluxe albums and to use the Apple Music skill for catalog lookups.
- Replaced clean album IDs/artwork in hip-hop story with explicit originals via Apple Music catalog lookups.
- DS2 only surfaced as explicit deluxe in the catalog; Donda only surfaced as clean (non-deluxe).
