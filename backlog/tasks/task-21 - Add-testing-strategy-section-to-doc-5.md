## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a Testing Strategy section to doc-5 (iOS story renderer architecture) covering:

- Parser unit tests with sample MDX fixtures
- Integration tests for StoryPackageLoader with test bundles
- UI snapshot tests for StoryRendererView components
- Playback coordinator mocking strategy for MusicKit

This ensures the architecture doc is complete for implementation planning.
