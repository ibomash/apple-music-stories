<Section id="prelude" title="North Minneapolis, 1958–1978" layout="lede">
The first scenes are winter-lit: North Minneapolis, a kid with a piano at seven, a local band circuit that doubles as an apprenticeship. Prince Rogers Nelson absorbs everything — gospel chords, James Brown's command, the sting of rock guitar — and then rebuilds it in his own basement, a private workshop in which he refuses to be just a singer, or just a player, or just a writer.

By nineteen he is signed to Warner Bros., and by 1978 he has delivered _For You_, a debut that already sounds like an artist refusing to wait his turn. The record is modest in scale, but the blueprint is there: falsetto as weapon, rhythm as architecture, the studio as a place where one person can play a whole band.

<SideNote label="Control">
  Prince's early deals gave him unusual creative power. It wasn't just a contract; it was a declaration that the sound would be authored, not assembled.

<Section id="ascent" title="Controversy to 1999">
By the early eighties, Prince is writing a city into his music: a neon Minneapolis where funk and rock share the same midnight street. _Controversy_ sharpens the edge; _1999_ throws the doors wide, a party record that still carries a warning. The production becomes architectural — stacked vocals, synths like signage, drums cut with a scalpel — and the performances assume a new kind of control, theatrical without ever losing their sweat.

The phrase "1999" isn't nostalgia, it's a spell. When it arrives, it makes the future feel reachable and dangerous at the same time. It also changes the stakes: he is no longer a cult savant; he is the kind of star who can bend radio to his taste.

<FullBleed src="https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/56/a7/64/56a7645d-4a05-f470-8fcd-5d9d68b7189d/886448877554.jpg/1200x1200bb.jpg" alt="1999 album cover" caption="A forecast in neon: the record that turned the party into prophecy." />

The videos from this period established Prince as a visual artist. The clip for "1999" turns neon apocalypse into a dance floor, a future-shock party with a skyline behind the groove. "Little Red Corvette" makes seduction cinematic, a dream sequence in slow headlights — Prince as romantic lead, MTV as the new drive-in.

<Section id="purple-rain" title="Purple Rain, the movie and the moment">
Then comes 1984, and _Purple Rain_ arrives like a floodlight. The film is a Minneapolis fever dream, the album an eighties monolith. It wins an Oscar for its score, but the real victory is the scale: Prince turns his private cosmos into a public ritual, complete with rain, motorcycles, and the way a chorus can feel like a cathedral.

"When Doves Cry" is the hinge. No bass line, all tension — a pop single that sounds like a seance. The title track, meanwhile, is a slow burn that ends in a sing-along grief. You can hear him pulling rock, gospel, and arena drama into a single, impossible silhouette.

<DropQuote attribution="Prince">
  Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life.
</DropQuote>

The videos seal the iconography. "When Doves Cry" is pure provocation — mirrored rooms, bare torso, emotion as choreography. "Let's Go Crazy" captures the _Purple Rain_ sermon and turns it into a stage-stomping rite. And "Raspberry Beret" blooms in color, a pastoral fantasy painted like a pop mural. The live capture of "Purple Rain" from Syracuse preserves the climactic ceremony, a stage-baptism that became legend.

<Section id="sign-o-times" title="Sign o' the Times and the maximalist middle">
After the purple storm, the work grows broader, stranger. The mid-eighties albums are a collage of personas and tempos: _Parade_ is a lean, cinematic black-and-white; "Kiss" arrives as a minimalist dare — a lean groove, a teasing guitar, a voice that is all implication and power.

_Sign o' the Times_ is the crown of that period: a double album that moves from social reportage to bedroom gospel to psychedelic comedy without ever breaking its spell. It is Prince as editor, as archivist, as the only person inside his own story who can cut it to shape.

The videos continue to define the era. "Kiss" is minimalism weaponized: a glance, a grin, a strut. "Sign O' The Times" makes the song's headlines visual, a stark performance as reportage. "U Got The Look" is rock 'n' roll as runway, a glam-charged duet in a black-and-white blaze. And "Alphabet St." is rhythmic theater, a kaleidoscope of wordplay and groove.

<Section id="symbol" title="The Symbol years and the freedom campaign">
The nineties arrive with a legal fight and a new alphabet. In 1993, amid a very public dispute with Warner Bros., Prince adopts an unpronounceable symbol and becomes "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince." It is a branding headache and a radical gesture: a refusal to be owned by a label or a name. The albums pour out in a rush, and so do the side projects, as if speed itself were a form of liberation.

The music from this era can feel like a hallway of doors: R&B one room, rock the next, jazz around the corner. Some of it is a feast, some of it is a provocation, but it is always a statement of intent — he will decide the pace, the terms, the air.

The _Batman_ soundtrack had already shown Prince's appetite for spectacle, and "Batdance" is maximalist collage — a comic-book fever dream at club volume. In the early nineties, the New Power Generation era brings "Cream," which turns swagger into choreography, all velvet, grin, and controlled chaos, and "Diamonds and Pearls," which glows with NPG polish — elegance as propulsion.

<FeatureBox title="The Paisley Park principle" summary="Independence wasn't a phase; it was the point." expandable="true">
  The symbol era was loud, messy, and visionary in the way that real reinvention often is. Prince turned rights and ownership into art itself, and in doing so, he made the industry's machinery visible. The music that followed carried that same insistence: control over tempo, control over narrative, control over the future of a catalog.

<Section id="renaissance" title="Musicology, late bloom, and the long goodbye">
By 2004, _Musicology_ arrives as a return to the main stage — a warm, horn-lit album that feels like Prince re-entering the room on his own terms. The tours are expansive, the shows engineered for joy, and the record becomes a commercial renaissance without sanding down his strangeness.

The later albums are full of craft and curiosity, with _ART OFFICIAL AGE_ sounding like a conversation between futurism and memory. Even in his final years, Prince is still building rooms, still expanding the house.

He dies in 2016 at Paisley Park, but the story doesn't stop. It reverberates: a catalog that behaves like a city, a blueprint for control, a life that insisted on the right to be more than a name.
