<Section id="intro" title="The Hook" layout="lede">
The opening synths land like a promise. Rick Astley, then 21, delivers a vocal that is both earnest and sly, riding a groove engineered for forever loops. The production is immaculate, the melody is sticky, and the chorus is all handshake and wink.

<DropQuote attribution="Rick Astley">
  Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down.

<SideNote label="Studio craft">
  The single was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, whose glossy pop formula defined late 80s radio.

<Section id="charts" title="Chart Takeover">
The single ruled the U.K. for five weeks and became the best-selling song in Britain in 1987. In the U.S., it reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1988 and held for two weeks. It was pop perfection at the exact moment MTV could beam it into every living room.

<FeatureBox title="Why the hook endures" summary="A chorus built to loop" expandable="true">
  The melody climbs in short, confident steps, and the harmony never breaks its bright major promise. That reliability is exactly why the hook survives as a meme and a crowd sing-along.

<Section id="video" title="The Video and the Meme">
The video is all trench coat swagger and brick-wall choreography, perfectly matched to the song's sincerity. The internet twist turned it into a gag, but it also kept the song in rotation for a new generation that learned to love the chorus even while laughing.
