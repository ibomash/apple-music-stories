# Apple Music Stories

This project is meant to facilitate ways of creating and consuming rich “music stories” where musical writing integrates with playback of music and videos from Apple Music’s streaming library. Some ideas at this point are:
- Create a display-independent document format that describes text alongside Apple Music links.
- Build agents that take a request and possibly some music background and create a “story” format for that information, linked with items from Apple Music.
- Build tools or agents that take a “music story” document and create a nice magazine-like web page, tailored for that story’s content, with integrated Apple Music playback.
- Build an iOS app that displays a “music story” document with integrated playback.
